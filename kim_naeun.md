# The Intouchables

This music is played in the last scene of the film. It is the scene where the main character Philippe and his caregiver and friend, Driss, say goodbye. Philippe has lost his will to live and is in despair after Driss quit his job as a caregiver. In order to help Philippe regain his motivation, Driss arranges a meeting with a woman he has been hesitant to meet for a long time. After Driss leaves, Philippe waits for her in a restaurant, feeling nervous, but soon she appears and Philippe smiles brightly, and the film ends. [The piano music ‘Una Mattina’](https://youtu.be/ymMYzb2HBsg?si=3QtQ2TQubA58KmSm) that plays at this time seems to portray the main character Philippe’s disability in a three-dimensional way. It makes us sympathize with the bitter and empty heart of the main character who has lost his physical freedom, while also making us feel hopeful that he can live happily with his friends and in love with his lover.

In the film [My Left Foot](kim_jua.md), the classical piece ‘Theme from My Left Foot’ expresses not only the protagonist’s physical pain but also his determination to overcome it. Through this music, we can feel both the limitations caused by his disability and a sense of hope.

# 나의 장례식에 나오길 바라는 음악

[이찬혁 (LEE CHANHYUK) - ‘장례희망 (Funeral hope)’](https://youtu.be/GE4V_fa9pkQ?si=OfF9GwUbDOBJaj7U)
이 노래를 들으며 나의 장례식에 대해 상상해보게 되었다. '나는 언제 죽게 될까?', '내 장례식엔 누가 올까?', '사람들은 어떤 반응을 보일까?'와 같은 생각들이 이어졌다. 또한 노래 가사에도 공감이 되었다. 특히 '모두 여기서 다시 볼 거라는 확신이 있네'라는 가사를 통해 나의 마음을 대변하여, 장례식에 참석한 사람들을 위로할 수 있을 것 같다.
